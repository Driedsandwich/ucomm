## 2025-08-29 22:01 - Context Recovery Post-Migration

### メタ（自動）
- TS: 20250829-2201  
- Branch: verify/workspace-migration-20250828_213908
- Changed files: 127 files with extensive CI artifacts and smoke test evidence

### 引き継ぎ要約（<=2000字）

#### Goal/Scope
Context recovery and status assessment after workspace migration verification. The current branch contains Phase 4 completion with comprehensive CI infrastructure enhancements, cross-platform smoke testing, and workspace migration validation.

#### Key decisions（採用/却下＋理由）
- **採用**: Extensive cross-platform smoke testing (17279929054 series)
  - Reason: Comprehensive validation across macOS, Ubuntu, Windows platforms
- **採用**: Multi-layer CI artifact preservation (ci-logs/, ci-real/, ci-remote/)
  - Reason: Evidence collection for Phase 4.3 completion and audit trail
- **採用**: Workspace migration with health monitoring
  - Reason: System stability verification after migration (artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json)
- **採用**: MCP-in-CI RFC implementation with technical feasibility analysis
  - Reason: Foundation for future CI/CD improvements (docs/RFCs/RFC-mcp-in-ci.md)

#### Done / Pending  
**Done:**
- ✅ Phase 4.1-4.3 complete with DOD compliance
- ✅ Cross-platform smoke tests executed and artifacts preserved
- ✅ Workspace migration validation with health evidence
- ✅ CI success rate monitoring infrastructure (scripts/ci/ci_success_rate.sh)
- ✅ Configurable role mapping system (config/roles.conf)
- ✅ MCP endpoint health validation and monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive artifact collection (127 changed files from main)

**Pending:**
- 🔄 Artifact cleanup strategy (multiple smoke-* directories consuming disk space)
- 🔄 Branch integration to main (extensive changes require careful merge)
- 🔄 Production deployment readiness validation
- 🔄 Final security and performance review
- 🔄 Version 0.5.0 release preparation

#### Next actions（3–7個）
1. **Artifact analysis** - Review smoke test results across all platforms for issues
2. **Disk cleanup** - Implement retention policy for CI artifacts (currently ~127 files)
3. **Integration preparation** - Plan merge strategy for verify branch → main
4. **Security review** - Final audit before production deployment
5. **Performance validation** - Ensure migrations haven't degraded performance
6. **Documentation finalization** - Update release notes and operational docs
7. **Release preparation** - Execute RELEASE_CHECKLIST_v0.5.0.md

#### Affected files（path:line）
- scripts/platform/smoke.sh:1-50 (cross-platform smoke testing)
- scripts/health.sh:1-200 (health monitoring enhancements) 
- config/roles.conf:1-10 (role mapping configuration)
- docs/RFCs/RFC-mcp-in-ci.md:1-100 (MCP CI integration specification)
- artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json (migration health evidence)
- 127 total files changed from main branch

#### Repro/Commands
```bash
# Current status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Health verification
./scripts/health.sh --json

# Smoke test execution  
./scripts/platform/smoke.sh

# MCP endpoint check
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:39200/health --max-time 6

# Artifact review
find artifacts/ -name "*.json" | head -10
```

#### Risks/Unknowns
- **Disk space**: Extensive CI artifacts may require cleanup (untracked directories)
- **Integration complexity**: 127 changed files from main require careful merge planning
- **Platform compatibility**: Windows-specific implementations need validation
- **Performance impact**: Migration effects on system performance unknown
- **Production readiness**: Final validation pending before v0.5.0 release

- MCP-in-CI RFC: docs/RFCs/RFC-mcp-in-ci.md
- Release Checklist: RELEASE_CHECKLIST_v0.5.0.md
- Health Evidence: artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json

## 2025-08-29 16:28 - Smoke Test Handoff

### メタ（自動）

- Changed files: -

### 引き継ぎ要約（<=2000字）

#### Goal/Scope
Smoke testing verification and workspace migration validation on the verify/workspace-migration-20250828_213908 branch. The branch contains completed Phase 4 work with comprehensive CI smoke testing across multiple platforms (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows).

#### Key decisions（採用/却下＋理由）
- **採用**: Cross-platform smoke test artifacts preserved in untracked directories for analysis
  - Reason: Evidence collection for Phase 4.3 completion validation
- **採用**: Workspace migration verification with health evidence collection  
  - Reason: Ensure system stability after workspace changes
- **採用**: Multiple smoke test run preservation (17279929054 series)
  - Reason: Cross-platform comparison and debugging capability

#### Done / Pending
**Done:**
- ✅ Phase 4 completion with comprehensive enhancements
- ✅ Cross-platform smoke tests executed (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows)
- ✅ Workspace migration with health evidence collection (artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json)
- ✅ CI remote testing with dispatch and PR runs (artifacts/ci-remote/20250828_215253/)
- ✅ Health monitoring and MCP endpoint verification
- ✅ Platform-specific artifact collection and logging

**Pending:**
- 🔄 Smoke test artifact cleanup and archival decision
- 🔄 Branch merge strategy evaluation (verify branch → main)
- 🔄 Production deployment readiness assessment
- 🔄 Documentation updates for v0.5.0 final release

#### Next actions（3–7個）
1. **Review smoke test results** - Analyze artifacts from all platform runs for any issues
2. **Clean up untracked artifacts** - Decide retention policy for smoke-* directories
3. **Merge verification** - Prepare verify branch for integration to main
4. **Production deployment prep** - Review RELEASE_CHECKLIST_v0.5.0.md
5. **Archive CI artifacts** - Move artifacts/ci-remote to permanent storage
6. **Update documentation** - Finalize any outstanding docs for v0.5.0
7. **Security review** - Final check before production release

#### Affected files（path:line）
- scripts/platform/smoke.sh:1-23 (smoke test implementation)
- minimal_test.sh:1-15 (CLI adapter testing)
- artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json (health evidence)
- docs/PHASES/phase4.md:1-15 (completion status)
- Multiple smoke-* directories (untracked, platform-specific artifacts)

#### Repro/Commands
```bash
# Health check
./scripts/health.sh --json

# Smoke test
./scripts/platform/smoke.sh

# MCP health verification
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:39200/health --max-time 6

# Branch status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

#### Risks/Unknowns
- **Artifact storage**: Large untracked artifact directories may consume significant disk space
- **Branch integration**: Verify branch has not been tested against latest main changes
- **Platform compatibility**: Windows-specific paths and behaviors need validation
- **Production readiness**: Final security and performance review pending
