## 引き継ぎ要約（<=2000字）

### Goal/Scope
Context recovery and status assessment after workspace migration verification. The current branch contains Phase 4 completion with comprehensive CI infrastructure enhancements, cross-platform smoke testing, and workspace migration validation.

### Key decisions（採用/却下＋理由）
- **採用**: Extensive cross-platform smoke testing (17279929054 series)
  - Reason: Comprehensive validation across macOS, Ubuntu, Windows platforms
- **採用**: Multi-layer CI artifact preservation (ci-logs/, ci-real/, ci-remote/)
  - Reason: Evidence collection for Phase 4.3 completion and audit trail
- **採用**: Workspace migration with health monitoring
  - Reason: System stability verification after migration (artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json)
- **採用**: MCP-in-CI RFC implementation with technical feasibility analysis
  - Reason: Foundation for future CI/CD improvements (docs/RFCs/RFC-mcp-in-ci.md)

### Done / Pending  
**Done:**
- ✅ Phase 4.1-4.3 complete with DOD compliance
- ✅ Cross-platform smoke tests executed and artifacts preserved
- ✅ Workspace migration validation with health evidence
- ✅ CI success rate monitoring infrastructure (scripts/ci/ci_success_rate.sh)
- ✅ Configurable role mapping system (config/roles.conf)
- ✅ MCP endpoint health validation and monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive artifact collection (127 changed files from main)

**Pending:**
- 🔄 Artifact cleanup strategy (multiple smoke-* directories consuming disk space)
- 🔄 Branch integration to main (extensive changes require careful merge)
- 🔄 Production deployment readiness validation
- 🔄 Final security and performance review
- 🔄 Version 0.5.0 release preparation

### Next actions（3–7個）
1. **Artifact analysis** - Review smoke test results across all platforms for issues
2. **Disk cleanup** - Implement retention policy for CI artifacts (currently ~127 files)
3. **Integration preparation** - Plan merge strategy for verify branch → main
4. **Security review** - Final audit before production deployment
5. **Performance validation** - Ensure migrations haven't degraded performance
6. **Documentation finalization** - Update release notes and operational docs
7. **Release preparation** - Execute RELEASE_CHECKLIST_v0.5.0.md

### Affected files（path:line）
- scripts/platform/smoke.sh:1-50 (cross-platform smoke testing)
- scripts/health.sh:1-200 (health monitoring enhancements) 
- config/roles.conf:1-10 (role mapping configuration)
- docs/RFCs/RFC-mcp-in-ci.md:1-100 (MCP CI integration specification)
- artifacts/ci-local/health_20250828_213848.json (migration health evidence)
- 127 total files changed from main branch

### Repro/Commands
```bash
# Current status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Health verification
./scripts/health.sh --json

# Smoke test execution  
./scripts/platform/smoke.sh

# MCP endpoint check
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:39200/health --max-time 6

# Artifact review
find artifacts/ -name "*.json" | head -10
```

### Risks/Unknowns
- **Disk space**: Extensive CI artifacts may require cleanup (untracked directories)
- **Integration complexity**: 127 changed files from main require careful merge planning
- **Platform compatibility**: Windows-specific implementations need validation
- **Performance impact**: Migration effects on system performance unknown
- **Production readiness**: Final validation pending before v0.5.0 release
